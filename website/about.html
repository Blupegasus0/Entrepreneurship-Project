                <h3>Our Team</h3>
                <p>
                    During the initial stages we will need to hire a social media manager to provide high quality social media
                    advertising and community interaction. However this role can be temporarily filled by one of the members of
                    our team. We will also need a farming consultant to provide us with feedback and new ideas from the 
                    perspective of an experienced farmer. This service will likely be available at no cost to us. Fortunately 
                    our team members are capable developers, as such, we have all of the human resources necessary for the 
                    development of the software.
                    We intend to employ a number of tactics to reduce the liability of newness. These include: talking with other 
                    entrepreneurs and learning from their mistakes and experiences, meeting with businesses in the industry to 
                    gain their support, and speaking to potential consumers to ensure we can meet their needs. Another benefit 
                    is that we have team members that are supportive of each other and are proficient at their individual tasks.

                <h4>Uniqueness</h4>
                <p>There aren't any other apps stationed in the Caribbean geared towards small farmers the way we are.</p>
                
                <h4>Affordablity</h4>
                <p>Compared to other Major Apps on the market who are more expensive and catered more to the larger scaled farms<br>
                    our app and services are alot more affordable for the much smaller scale farmers and you wont be overwhelmed<br> 
                    by too many hard to use functions that other apps may include.</p>

                <h3>Feasibility Analysis</h3>
                <br>

                <h4>Product/Service</h4>
                <p>
                    Agri-Service provides the best solution to small farmers who find it challenging to maintain their bookkeeping 
                    system. The creation of this cost effective website was conceptualized by information gathered from the small 
                    farmers themselves recognizing that they spend lots of time doing the labor and not efficiently manage there 
                    finances. 
                </p>
                <h4>Industry/Target Market</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our company being new to the market shows the start of our life cycle. The service that is being offered is a 
                    “want to have “ rather than a “must have “ as farmers realize there was need to have a system which allows for 
                    more convenience and better management. Senior citizens still pushing their small farming can find this system 
                    very user friendly and convenient.  The increase number of small farmers due to the unemployment or just want 
                    to be entrepreneurs would benefit from our service. 
                </p>
                <h4>Organizational</h4>
                <p>
                    Undertaking this new venture, various personnel needed to be identified to have a successful start-up which 
                    is what Agri-Service comprise:
                    Team manager
                    Web Developer
                    Software Developer
                    Marketing Manager  
                    Visionary Team
                    Social Media Manager
                    The skill sets of the personnel of Agri-Service allows the company to be sufficient in the resources required 
                    to grow and expand.
