<h3>Uniqueness</h3>
<p>There aren't any other apps stationed in the Caribbean geared towards small farmers the way we are.</p>

<h3>Productivity</h3>
<p>Most small farmers dont have time to Scan through multiple documents and they mostly focus on the<br> front end of farming
but with our easy to use document sorter, you will be able to rest easy as we make<br> sure you are able to keep track of all your important documents.</p>

<p>Compared to other Major Apps on the market who are more expensive and catered more to the larger scaled farms<br>
our app and services are alot more affordable for the much smaller scale farmers and you wont be overwhelmed<br> 
by too many hard to use functions that other apps man include.</p>
